With a given sequence of heights of students, please give a way to help the teacher to decide whether the teacher can have an increasing list by rotating the list. For example, given a sequence of numbers $S=\\{6,8,9,3,5\\}$, $S$ can be rotated to be an increasing list as $\\{3,5,6,8,9\\}$ but the other example $S'=\\{1,4,5,2,3\\}$ can not be an increasing list by rotations. The input of this problem thus is a sequence of numbers and the function `rotated_increasing()` is to determine whether the input sequence can be an increasing list by rotations."
